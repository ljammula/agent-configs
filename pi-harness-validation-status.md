# pi harness — consolidated validation status

**Current as of 2026-08-04.** This file states only what's true right now,
extension by extension. The full dated investigation — what was tried, what
broke, what got fixed, live-run counts, superseded results — lives in
`pi-harness-history.md`; nothing here is understandable-only-with-history,
but that file is where the "why" and "how do we know" detail is if you want
it.

## Current configuration

Pi 0.83.0 has two resident inference routes: `ThinkingCap-Qwen3.6-27B-MLX-8bit`
on `:8080` (primary, host `kannasmacstudio.lan`) and `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` on
`:8082` (reviewer, same host). `AI_REVIEW_BASE_URL`/`AI_REVIEW_MODEL` are now
set in `~/.zshrc`, so `cross-model-review.ts` resolves to genuine
`independent-review` rather than disabling itself; same-primary review still
requires `AI_REVIEW_ALLOW_SELF=1` and is labeled `blind-self-review`, never
cross-model, if it's ever pointed back at the same route. The maintained Pi
project typechecks
against pinned 0.83.0 public types and has 74 deterministic tests covering
loading, event ordering, retry caps, current-diff verification, shell-masked
exits, reviewer truthfulness, symlink escapes, external-effect policy,
installer scope, stack routing, extension interactions, nested verification
manifests, and stale-extension-context handling.

Two acceptance boundaries remain intentionally not adopted:

- Docker is unavailable on this Mac. The containment Dockerfile and
  launcher pass static shell/install checks, but the live escape matrix is
  not proven.
- `continuation-nudge.ts` and `co-change-suggest.ts` remain source-tested
  but are removed from the installed runtime until randomized paired
  evidence meets the current adoption threshold.

## Current battery result

A completed nine-pair randomized screen (seed `20260802`, stock Pi vs. the
installed harness, strictly sequential, hidden tests overlaid after Pi
exited) is the current operational-hardening evidence:

- Hidden-test success: baseline 7/9, harness 8/9. Harness matched or beat
  baseline; its one loss (pair 4, go-flutter/bookmarks-app) was a shared
  failure baseline also hit — a `go test -race` data race in a
  visit-counter HTTP handler, a genuine 27B-model concurrency-reasoning
  gap, not a harness defect (detail in `pi-harness-history.md`'s pair-4
  deep-dive). An isolated spot-check (2026-08-03, not a paired battery run)
  reproduced the exact bug in a standalone repro package and gave it to
  `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` with only the `go test -race` failure output as
  context: it correctly diagnosed the pointer-outside-lock cause and
  applied the same snapshot-under-lock fix `pi-harness-history.md`'s
  root-cause note recommends; `go vet` and `go test -race` passed clean
  against a control that reproduced the original failure. This is n=1
  evidence Gemma may not share Qwen's concurrency-reasoning gap, not proof
  it clears the paired-battery bar — see todo below.
- Zero extension errors and zero `quality-gate: unconfigured` outcomes
  across all eighteen runs.
- Median paired runtime overhead: 100.3% (prompt tokens +212.6%, completion
  tokens +39.8%), above the plan's 20% screening threshold. This is the
  honestly-measured cost of quality-gate actually running its
  nested-manifest verification and corrective-follow-up loop on every
  pair, not a bug-distorted number.

## Extension-by-extension current status

| Extension | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `protected-paths.ts` | Adopted, on by default | Tool guard on Pi `write`/`edit`, not `bash`, symlink escapes, or OS-level confinement. Deterministic tests + 1 live catch (corrected an absolute-path escape). |
| `format-on-edit.ts` | Adopted, on by default | Deterministic gofmt/dart-format/prettier-if-present pass, not a judgment call. |
| `rtk-rewrite.ts` | Adopted, on by default | Deterministic bash-output filter. |
| `git-checkpoint.ts` | Adopted, on by default | Deterministic per-turn snapshotting. |
| `git-safety.ts` | Adopted | Blocks destructive git commands (`reset --hard`, `push --force` w/o lease, `clean -f`, `branch -D`, `checkout/restore -- .`). 1 scratch-repo reproduction plus deterministic tests. |
| `quality-gate.ts` | Adopted, on by default | Binds passing evidence to the current diff hash, rejects truncated/shell-masked results, runs the repo's canonical check (including nested manifests) at settlement, caps corrective follow-ups at three. Proven in the completed nine-pair battery above. |
| `stack-router.ts` | Adopted, on by default | Routes Go, Python, Flutter, TypeScript/JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Temporal, and GCP guidance from repository evidence. Deterministic tests for all routes; only Go/Dart routes have battery coverage (see battery result above), the rest are wired and unit-tested but not battery-proven. |
| `co-change-suggest.ts` | Default-disabled, source-tested | One real retrospective replay (ranked target file #1 of 8) does not meet the paired-adoption threshold. Live (non-retrospective) validation not run. |
| `continuation-nudge.ts` | Default-disabled, source-tested | Deterministic branch tests pass; the widened empty-content-stop trigger has zero real-trial field evidence. |
| `cross-model-review.ts` | Adopted, resolves to genuine `independent-review`, but its trigger cannot fire on the current task suite | `AI_REVIEW_BASE_URL`/`AI_REVIEW_MODEL` set in `~/.zshrc` to `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` on `:8082`, distinct from the `:8080` Qwen primary. Deterministic tests pass (74/74); live-checked 2026-08-04 that `resolveReviewerConfig()` resolves `independent-review` (not `disabled`/`blind-self-review`) and that `requestReview()` correctly flagged a deliberately planted bug against the real endpoint. A separate 2026-08-04 investigation against a third route (KAT-Coder, `:8083`, not the standing config) found and fixed a process-crashing stale-context bug in the `tool_result` catch handler and a structural gap where `pi -p` exited before any review round could finish; both fixed, tested, and now apply to whichever route is configured — see `pi-harness-history.md`'s "Trying a third reviewer route" section. `REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MS` raised from 120s to 240s (commit `83ca0cb`) after a real production-shaped review request against idle Gemma took 121.4s — 1.4s past the old timeout, which would have silently discarded a correct finding. A full end-to-end rerun (2026-08-04, standing Qwen+Gemma config, pair 4) confirmed the task itself passes cleanly (9/9 go -race, 17/17 dart) but the reviewer never fired: its `tool_result` trigger only reacts to the *model's own* successful broad-verification command, and `local-model-bench` hides real test files until after `pi` exits, so the model never has one to run — it wrote its own smoke test instead, and its one `dart test` call errored on "no test files," which the trigger explicitly excludes. No route, model, or timeout can fix this; it needs a design change (e.g. a settlement-time trigger like `quality-gate.ts`'s). See todo. |
| Phase 4 (Aider-based failing-test retry) | Deliberately not built | Gated on Aider dispatch being in scope; it isn't (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, benchmarked and removed). |
| KAT-Coder-V2.5-Dev-OptiQ-4bit (`:8083`) | Ruled out, both roles | **As primary model**: spot-checked 2026-08-04 against pair 4 (go-flutter/bookmarks-app) — fixed the `go test -race` bug that stumped Qwen, but introduced 3 new Dart test failures and the task still failed overall; independent review found this is not real signal, since Qwen itself already fixes this same race in 2/5 runs on its own (see `pi-harness-history.md`'s prior five-run investigation), so a single win is statistically indistinguishable from Qwen's known variance. **As reviewer**: ruled out for a structural reason, not a tunable one — a real production-shaped review request (task spec + diff, 22,784 chars, no `max_tokens` cap) against a confirmed-idle `:8083` route ran 220+ seconds and never completed successfully (`upstream_errors` incremented rather than `completed`). Unlike Gemma's near-miss on the timeout, this wasn't close: the route errored out rather than merely running long, so raising `REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MS` would not fix it. Full detail in `pi-harness-history.md`'s "KAT-Coder ruled out" section. |

## Todo

- Give `cross-model-review.ts` a settlement-time trigger (mirroring
  `quality-gate.ts`'s `agent_settled` hook) so it can fire against
  `local-model-bench` tasks at all — its current purely reactive
  `tool_result` trigger structurally cannot activate on this suite, since
  hidden tests don't exist yet during the model's own session (see
  `pi-harness-history.md`'s 2026-08-04 pair-4 rerun). Without this, the
  existing goal of rerunning the seeded battery with the reviewer live can
  produce a full run of green trace data with zero actual review rounds,
  and look like adoption evidence when it isn't.
- Rerun pair 4 (go-flutter/bookmarks-app) specifically as a full paired
  battery task, not just the isolated bug repro, to see whether Gemma's
  spot-check win on the visit-counter race generalizes to the actual task
  end-to-end (harness loop, quality-gate corrective retries, other tests
  in the suite) before drawing any conclusion beyond n=1. Any future
  candidate-model claim on this task (Gemma, KAT-Coder, or otherwise) needs
  roughly 8-10 paired runs to be distinguishable from Qwen's own ~40%
  (2/5) base rate at fixing this race on its own — a single win is not
  evidence.
- Run TypeScript/JavaScript task fixtures through the battery — currently
  routed and unit-tested only, same status as Python/Postgres/Kafka/Temporal/GCP.
- Bind verification to the final tree/diff across all judgment-dependent
  extensions consistently — quality-gate does this; confirm the others do
  too.
- Move DayTrix-only skills out of the global Pi skill directory and into
  that project, leaving generic backend/full-stack guidance global.
- Use an OS/container boundary for unattended execution once Docker is
  available on this host — the protected-path guard is defense in depth,
  not filesystem confinement.
- `co-change-suggest.ts`'s live (non-retrospective) validation — "try it
  live on one new personal-assistant feature task" — has not been run.
- `continuation-nudge.ts`'s widened trigger has zero field validation.
  Needs real trials before its empty-content-stop path can be said to
  work, not just to type-check.
- Reduce quality-gate's runtime/token overhead below the plan's 20%
  threshold, or revise the threshold with evidence for why the current
  cost is acceptable.
