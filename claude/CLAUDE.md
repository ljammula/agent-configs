# Global Claude Preferences

## GitHub Accounts

- **Primary**: `ljammula` (https://github.com/ljammula) — owner account, used for commits, pushes, and all default operations
- **Secondary**: `narsimha-j` (https://github.com/narsimha-j) — used for code reviews only

## Code Reviews

Always use the GitHub account **narsimha-j** (https://github.com/narsimha-j) when performing code reviews, submitting review comments, or any GitHub review-related actions. Always submit reviews as `APPROVE` (not `COMMENT`) when all issues are resolved.

### GitHub account permissions
- **narsimha-j** can: submit reviews, approve PRs, post comments
- **narsimha-j** cannot: push to repos it doesn't own, resolve review threads on others' repos
- For code reviews: switch to `narsimha-j` via `gh auth switch --user narsimha-j`, perform the review, then switch back with `gh auth switch --user ljammula`

## Commits

Commit using the global git config (ljammula). Do NOT add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.

## Code Quality

Codex reviews all code written in any project. Write clean, well-structured code with no hacks or unclear logic — every change is subject to automated review.

## Coding Guidelines

Always apply the `karpathy-guidelines` skill when writing, reviewing, or refactoring code. Invoke it via the Skill tool at the start of any coding task.
